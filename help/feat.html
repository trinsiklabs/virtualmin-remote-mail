<header>Use remote mail server?</header>

When this feature is enabled, Virtualmin will configure a remote mail server
to handle all email for the domain. This includes:<p>

<ul>
<li>DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM) pointing to the remote mail server</li>
<li>Postfix transport maps on the remote server for mail routing</li>
<li>Dovecot mail accounts on the remote server</li>
<li>OpenDKIM signing configuration for outgoing email</li>
<li>SSL certificate synchronization for encrypted connections</li>
</ul>

This feature cannot be used together with the local Mail feature, as they
would conflict. The DNS feature must also be enabled.<p>
